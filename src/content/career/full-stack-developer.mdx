A designer plays a key role in a creative company. Using elements like typography, illustration, photography and layouts, a designer always has an extremely creative mind that can absorb visual trends and deploy them in fresh and exciting ways.

The skills that a product designer must have range from technical to human-centered design. Product designers take part in user research, prototyping, visualization, testing, analyzing, and communicating.
